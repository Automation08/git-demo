1. Create a folder in local machine - for example - git-demo 
2. open command prompt in that folder and run this command to initialize local git repository- git init 
3. Go to GitHub -- https://github.com/
4. Create a new repository in git hub web using same name as local for example here: git-demo
5. Connect the local repository to Remote git repository using this command - git remote add origin https://github.com/Kalwantrao/git-demo.git
6. Now run this command to set the master branch  for commits - git push --set-upstream origin master
7. create one file for example - index.js
8. Run the command to check the status of that file locally - git status
9. Now add this file to local staging repository using this commands - git add index.js
10. Commit this file locally using - git commit -m "First commit"
11. Run this command to push the file to remote repository - git push
12. Now go to GitHub web and check the code file, index.js file should appear in master branch. 

13. Create a subbranch with master as source branch from GitHub web: it will create the exact copy of master branch  with other name as you provided- for example here - feature/demo-feature
14. Go to local folder run this command to fetch the new branch locally -  git pull 
15. Run this command to switch the working branch to new branch - git checkout feature/demo-feature
16. Create a new file for example here: demo.txt
17. Now follow the same steps to push the file to remote repository: git add,  git commit -m " ", and then git push
18. Check the guthub web the new file demo.txt will be added on  feature/demo-feature only and not added on master.
19. Now create a pull request and add the reviewers.
20. Now merge this feature/demo-feature branch with master.
